When 'clock.py' is run, an image is generated, which represents the time as a FibonacciClock would. This image has the same size as the screen.

 Colors for each state can be modified.

Running 'cron.py' will start a process which runs 'clock.py' every five minutes, for automatic image generation.

Necessary modules:
  * screeninfo
  * pillow
  * schedule
